## Functions

#### Introduction to Functions

`Functions` look very similar to `equations` with one notable exception $\ldots$

Take a look at these two examples and see if you can spot the difference:

\begin{align*}
	y = 5x+7 \textrm{ where } x\in\mathbb{R} && \textrm{ and } && f(x) = 5x+7 \textrm{ where x}\in\mathbb{R}
\end{align*}
